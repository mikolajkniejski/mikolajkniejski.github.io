# Hi, I'm Ninell

I'm an incoming PhD student in the Philosophy of AI at the University of Copenhagen where I will look at the (dis)similarities between human brains and artificial systems. Before that, I did my Master's there in IT & Cognition and a Bachelor's in Computational Linguistics in Potsdam, Germany. 

I'm broadly interested in using human language and language models to learn about human cooperation and decision-making, and how to use all of that to make AI go well. For this, I like to look at findings from linguistics, ecology, neuroscience, game theory, and philosophy. 

Other than that, I like live music, running, & maps.

Please reach out if you want to collaborate, discuss, or go to a gig together!

And here's a picture of my face:
