# Hi, I'm Ninell

I'm a 1st year's master student in it & cognition at the university of copenhagen, denmark. 

My research interest lies in ai ethics with a focus on NLP. before this, i was a traveling linguist in germany  (german speakers can read the respective blog [here](https://zwoelfmaldeutschland.de), and consider if they want to publish it as a book). Before this, i was doing my bachelor's in computational linguistics in potsdam, also germany, an erasmus in human-computer-interaction in trento, italy, and some years in linguistics, computer science & theatre science in berlin, of course germany.

Other than that, i like writing, [effective altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/), & running.

And here's a picture of my face:
