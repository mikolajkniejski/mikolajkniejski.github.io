# Hi, I'm Ninell

I'm a research fellow at [PIBBSS](https://www.pibbss.ai/), Principles of Intelligent Behavior in Biological and Social Systems, where I model social norm inference and sustenance. Before that, I did my Master's in IT & Cognition in Copenhagen and a Bachelor's in Computational Linguistics in Potsdam, Germany. 

I'm interested in cooperation and collective intelligence, how language and communication play into that, and how to use all of that to make AI go well. I think building models that are interpretable from scratch is interesting and promising for that direction. For this, I like to look at findings from ecology, game theory, and philosophy. 

Other than that, I like live music, running, & maps.

Please reach out if you want to collaborate, discuss, or go to a gig together!

And here's a picture of my face:
