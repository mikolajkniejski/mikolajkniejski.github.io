# Hi, I'm Ninell

I'm a first-year PhD student at the Centre for Philosophy of AI at the University of Copenhagen supervised by (https://anderssoegaard.github.io/)[Anders SÃ¸gaard]. I'm trying to find out how to use language models best to learn about human decision-making, language use, or cooperation! For this, I like to draw inspiration from related fields such as (currently) explainability, neuro-symbolic computing, and bio-inspired AI.

Other than that, I like live music, running, & maps.

Please reach out if you want to collaborate, discuss, or go to a gig together!

And here's a picture of my face:
