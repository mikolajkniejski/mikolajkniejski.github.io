# Hi, I'm Ninell

I'm a research fellow at PIBBSS, Principles of Intelligent Behavior in Biological and Social Systems in Prague/Oxford where I investigate social norm learning and sustenance in a symbolic Bayesian way. Before that, I was doing a Master's in IT & Cognition in Copenhagen, Denmark and a Bachelor's in Computational Linguistics in Potsdam, Germany. 

My research interest lies in what cooperation and collective intelligence is and how to use it to make A.I. go well. Currently, I think that building models that are interpretable from scratch is interesting and promising for that direction. For this, I like to look at findings from ecology, game theory, and philosophy, amongst others. 

Other than that, I like live music, running, & maps.

If you want to collaborate, discuss, or go to a gig together, please don't hesitate to reach out.

And here's a picture of my face:
