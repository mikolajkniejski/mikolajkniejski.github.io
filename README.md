# Hi, I'm Ninell

I'm a PhD student at the Centre for Philosophy of AI at the University of Copenhagen and am interested in many things AI / Cognition / Language. For example, it'd be great to find out how to use language models best to learn about human decision-making, language use, or cooperation! This might draw inspiration from many related fields such as explainability, neuro-symbolic computing, and bio-inspired AI.

Other than that, I like live music, running, & maps.

Please reach out if you want to collaborate, discuss, or go to a gig together!

And here's a picture of my face:
