# Hi, I'm Ninell

I'm a 2nd-year Master's student in IT & Cognition at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark and currently on exchange at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

My main research interest lies in AI ethics (incl. bias in NLP systems & general ethics) and cooperative AI but recently, I've started being intrigued with game theory and it's implications for AI alignment. Also, I'd like to know more about interpretability of large language models.

Other than that, I like writing, [effective altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/), [music](https://open.spotify.com/user/nellsn?si=4087744fb08f4509), running, & maps.

And here's a picture of my face:
