# Hi, I'm Ninell

I'm a research fellow at PIBBSS, Principles of Intelligent Behavior in Biological and Social Systems in Prague/Oxford where I investigate social norm learning and sustenance in a symbolic Bayesian way. Before that, I was doing a Master's in IT & Cognition in Copenhagen, Denmark and a Bachelor's in Computational Linguistics in Potsdam, Germany. Broadly, my research interest lies in what cooperation and collective intelligence is and how to use it to make A.I. go well.

Currently, I think that building models that are interpretable from scratch is interesting and promising. For this, I think it's important to draw inspiration from biology, game theory, and philosophy, amongst others. Please reach out if you want to collaborate or talk about your views on that!

Other than that, I like live music, running, & maps.

And here's a picture of my face:
