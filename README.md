# Hi, I'm Ninell

I'm a 1st year's Master's student in IT & Cognition at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark. 

My research interest lies in AI ethics & (hopefully soon) AI Alignment with a focus on language processing. I think, the world can be a better place with the help of Python.

Other than that, I like writing, [effective altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/), [music](https://open.spotify.com/user/nellsn?si=4087744fb08f4509), & running.

And here's a picture of my face:
