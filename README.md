# Hi, I'm Mikolaj

I'm a cybersecurity specilist working at BLIK. Besides that I'm working to reduce harms from advanced artifical intelligence by conducting research at PRISM evals.

Otherwise, I'm interested in math, urban exploration and psychodelics.

Please reach out if you want to collaborate, discuss, or go to a gig together!
