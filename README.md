# Hi, I'm Ninell

I'm a 2nd-year Master's student in IT & Cognition at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark but currently on exchange at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

My main research interest lies in AI ethics (incl. bias in NLP systems & general ethics) but recently, I've started being intrigued with game theory and it's implications for AI Governance.

Other than that, I like writing, [effective altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/), [music](https://open.spotify.com/user/nellsn?si=4087744fb08f4509), running, & maps.

And here's a picture of my face:
