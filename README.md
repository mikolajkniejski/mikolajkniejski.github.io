# Hi, I'm Ninell

I'm a 1st year's master student in IT & Cognition at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark. 

My research interest lies in ai ethics with a focus on NLP. Before this, I was a traveling linguist in Germany (German speakers can read the respective blog [here](https://zwoelfmaldeutschland.de) and consider if they want to publish it as a book). Before this, I was doing my bachelor's in computational linguistics in Potsdam, also Germany, an Erasmus in human-computer-interaction in Trento, Italy, and some years in linguistics, computer science & theatre science in berlin, of course, Germany.

Other than that, I like writing, [effective altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/), & running.

And here's a picture of my face:
