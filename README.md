# Hi, I'm Ninell

I'm a 1st year's Master's student in IT & Cognition at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark. 

Before this, I was a traveling linguist in Germany (German speakers can read the respective blog [here](https://zwoelfmaldeutschland.de) and consider if they want to publish it as a book). Before this, I was doing my Bachelor's in Computational Linguistics in Potsdam, also Germany, an Erasmus in Human-Computer-Interaction in Trento, Italy, and some years in linguistics, computer science & theatre studies in Berlin, of course, Germany.

My research interest lies in AI ethics & (hopefully soon) AI Alignment with a focus on language processing. I think, the world can be a better place with the help of Python.

Other than that, I like writing, [effective altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/), & running.

And here's a picture of my face:
