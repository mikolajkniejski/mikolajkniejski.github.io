# Hi, I'm Ninell

I'm a first-year PhD student at the Centre for Philosophy of AI at the University of Copenhagen. I'm interested in many things at the intersection of AI, cognition, and language. For example, it'd be great to find out how to use language models best to learn about human decision-making, language use, or cooperation! For this, I like to draw inspiration from related fields such as explainability, neuro-symbolic computing, and bio-inspired AI.

Other than that, I like live music, running, & maps.

Please reach out if you want to collaborate, discuss, or go to a gig together!

And here's a picture of my face:
